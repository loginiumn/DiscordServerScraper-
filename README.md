# **DiscordServerScraper**

 **``A browser-based tool that exports Discord server member lists using Discord token authentication.``**

## WORKING IN PROGRESS 
> This tool is still under W.I.P, so if you’re trying to scrape member lists, it won’t work.

## Features

- **Fetch usernames and user IDs** – Retrieve basic member identifiers
- **User token based authentication** – Authenticate directly using your Discord token
- **Retrieve join dates** – Access member join timestamps
- **Direct Gateway API connection via WebSocket** – Connect to Discord's real-time API
- **Member data export** – Export results to usable file formats


## Guides
- Read the [Token.md](https://github.com/loginiumn/DiscordServerScraper/blob/main/Token.md)
- This will guide you on how to get your Discord token. If you have a Discord account, you can start by joining random servers to test if the tool works. Keep in mind, this tool is still a work in progress.
